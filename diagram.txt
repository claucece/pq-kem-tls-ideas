## TLS 1.3

Figure 1 below shows the basic full TLS handshake:

Auth | {CertificateVerify*}
     v {Finished}              -------->
       [Application Data]      <------->  [Application Data]

              +  Indicates noteworthy extensions sent in the
                 previously noted message.

              *  Indicates optional or situation-dependent
                 messages/extensions that are not always sent.

              {} Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from a [sender]_handshake_traffic_secret.

              [] Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from [sender]_application_traffic_secret_N.

The handshake can be thought of as having three phases (indicated in
the diagram above):

-  Key Exchange: Establish shared keying material and select the
   cryptographic parameters.  Everything after this phase is
   encrypted.

-  Server Parameters: Establish other handshake parameters
   (whether the client is authenticated, application-layer protocol
   support, etc.).

-  Authentication: Authenticate the server (and, optionally, the
   client) and provide key confirmation and handshake integrity.

In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello message,
which contains a random nonce (ClientHello.random); its offered protocol
versions; a list of symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs; either a set of
Diffie-Hellman key shares (in the "key_share" extension), a set of
pre-shared key labels (in the "pre_shared_key" extension), or both; and
potentially additional extensions. Additional fields and/or messages may also
be present for middlebox compatibility.

## PQ KEM TLS 1.3 for Server Authentication

Figure 1 below shows the basic full PQ KEM TLS handshake:

       Client                                           Server

Key  ^ ClientHello

     | + signature_algorithms (traditional + KEM)*
     | + psk_key_exchange_modes*
     v + pre_shared_key*       -------->
                                                  ServerHello  ^ Key
                    + key_share* (traditional + KEM key share) | Exch

                                        {EncryptedExtensions}  ^  Server
                                        {CertificateRequest*}  v  Params
                                               {Certificate*}  ^

     | {Finished}

                               <--------  [Application Data*]

              +  Indicates noteworthy extensions sent in the
                 previously noted message.

              *  Indicates optional or situation-dependent
                 messages/extensions that are not always sent.

              {} Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from a [sender]_handshake_traffic_secret.

              [] Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from [sender]_application_traffic_secret_N.

               Figure 1: Message Flow for Full TLS Handshake

In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello message,
which contains a random nonce (ClientHello.random); its offered protocol
versions (which must include TLS 1.3); a list of symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs;
either a set of Diffie-Hellman key shares and KEM keyshares (in
the "key_share" extension, with the corresponding "supported_group" extension -with the
corresponding KEM groups offered in it-), a set of pre-shared key labels (in
the "pre_shared_key" extension), or both; the signature_algorithms extension with the
corresponding KEM group (A "signature_algorithms_dc" extension may also be
added to indicate delegated credential signature algorithms), and potentially
additional extensions. Additional fields and/or messages may also be present for
middlebox compatibility.

The server processes the ClientHello and determines the appropriate
cryptographic parameters for the connection.  It then responds with
its own ServerHello, which indicates the negotiated connection parameters.
The combination of the ClientHello and the ServerHello determines the shared
keys.  If KEM key establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains
a "key_share" extension with the server's ephemeral KEM share; the server's
share MUST be in the same group as one of the client's shares.  If PSK key
establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains a "pre_shared_key"
extension indicating which of the client's offered PSKs was selected.
Note that implementations can use KEM, (EC)DHE and PSK together, in which case
both extensions will be supplied.

The server then sends a message to establish the Server Parameters:

EncryptedExtensions:  responses to ClientHello extensions that are
   not required to determine the cryptographic parameters, other than
   those that are specific to individual certificates.
   [Section 4.3.1]

Finally, the client and server exchange Authentication messages. PQ KEM TLS
uses the same set of messages every time that certificate-based
authentication is needed.  (PSK-based authentication happens as a
side effect of key exchange.)  Specifically:

Certificate:  The certificate of the endpoint and any per-certificate
   extensions.  This message is omitted by the server if not
   authenticating with a certificate. The long-term KEM public key
   should be in it.

ClientKEMCiphertext: an encapsulation against the long-term KEM public key,
   which yield an implicitly unauthenticated shared secret, used to derive
   authenticated handshake traffic secrets and a master secret.

Finished:  A MAC (Message Authentication Code) over the entire
   handshake.  This message provides key confirmation, binds the
   endpoint's identity to the exchanged keys, and in PSK mode also
   authenticates the handshake.  [Section 4.4.4]

At this point, the handshake is complete, and the client and server
derive the keying material required by the record layer to exchange
application-layer data protected through authenticated encryption.
Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished
message, except as specified in Section 2.3.  Note that while the
server may send Application Data prior to receiving the client's
Authentication messages, any data sent at that point is, of course,
being sent to an unauthenticated peer.
